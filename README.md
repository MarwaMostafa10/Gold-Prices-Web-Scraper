# Gold-Prices-Web-Scraper

ðŸ“Œ Project Description:
This Python script uses Web Scraping techniques to extract real-time gold prices from the iSagha market website (https://market.isagha.com/prices/). The script fetches data on different gold purities, including buy and sell prices, status, and latest price updates, and saves the extracted data into a CSV file for further analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used:
Python â€“ Core programming language
Requests â€“ To fetch the webpage content
BeautifulSoup (bs4) â€“ To parse and extract data from HTML
CSV Module â€“ To store the extracted data in a structured format
ðŸ“Œ How It Works:
The script sends an HTTP request to the iSagha gold prices page.
It parses the HTML structure using BeautifulSoup.
Extracts key details for each gold type, including:
Gold Purity (Ø¹ÙŠØ§Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø°Ù‡Ø¨)
Selling Price (Ø³Ø¹Ø± Ø§Ù„Ø¨ÙŠØ¹)

Market Status (Ø­Ø§Ù„Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø³ÙˆÙ‚)
Latest Price Update (Ø¢Ø®Ø± ØªØ­Ø¯ÙŠØ« Ù„Ù„Ø³Ø¹Ø±)
Stores the extracted data in a CSV file (golds_prices.csv) for analysis.
