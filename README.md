# Gold-Prices-Web-Scraper
This Python script uses Web Scraping techniques to extract real-time gold prices from the iSagha market website (https://market.isagha.com/prices/). The script fetches data on different gold purities, including buy and sell prices, status, and latest price updates, and saves the extracted data into a CSV file for further analysis.
